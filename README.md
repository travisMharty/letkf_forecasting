# letkf_forecasting

Add some information and tell me how and what files are needed to run the
system.


## Packaging

To use ``letkf_forecasting`` now, run ``pip install -e .`` in this directory
in your conda env to install the packaged in the editable mode. This means
any changes you make to the code are automatically reflected in the package.
Then you can ``import letkf_forecasting`` instead of doing a sys.path.append.
You may need to reload the module/ipython kernel for changes in the library
code to be reflected in the notebook.
