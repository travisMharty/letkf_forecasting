Error variance for sensor

Error variance for satellite

Error Covariances for satellite -- OI

Non-gaussian error for both

** .resample vs sp.interpolate for sensor data

H for sensors does not include fact that sensors are time average and sat are
space average. This should be in inflation, but does it need to be?

Better means of removing background --- look at SUNY code

Ensemble creation
         Shift CI map (by different h, by simple shifting,
         by using wind field (like shifts in time))

         What variances should be used for: wind, CI field, height

         Should CI field perturbation be constant over the whole domain or
         some smooth but changing field over the domain?

Include IO before assimilating satellite images
        Will need to do something somewhat clever such as domain localization in
        OI if the domain is too large.

Perform assimilation or advection on GPU?

Parallelize advection on multiple cores Dask?

Make advection faster with only matrix multiplication?

Optimize over:
         OI or no OI
            Types of OI and those parameters (can pull from dissertaion?)

         Different ensemble creation techniques including the standard
         deviations involved

         Sattellite/sensor error magnatude and inflation

         Satellite error structure

         localization distances and assimilation grid sizes

Do results improve with a larger domain or a smaller domain?

Should localization for sat update be in space or cloudiness?

Include cloudiness localization in sensor update

There could be an error for the parallrax correction if the corrected sensor
location leaves the satellite domain.
